I am a User Experience Designer, a teacher, and also an X-Man (no kidding).

My super power is empathy. I use my power to discover and deliver extraordinary solutions to technology-based problems through human-centered design. 

_While not practicing UX, I can be found shooting hoops, chomping on a burrito, organizing small spaces (closets and attics oh my!) ... or most likely of all, cuddling with my dog & cat. I am forever fascinated by how animals and people tick._
